    "The `album` object contains two central functions for interfacing with your collection's metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`FindSource(searchterms)`**: Basic search function which will return any filenames whose metadata contains the terms specified in a list of `searchterms`. Several optional filters, such as `fields` and `subfolders` allow for a more refined search, which will only look for the terms inside certain metadata fields or subfolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`GrabData()`**: Grabs all of the metadata into a Pandas `DataFrame()`. The optional filter `fields` allows you to specify which fields you want returned, and results can be refined to only include certain files or date ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these two functions have slightly different filter options for refining results, the combination of them can be used for fairly complex searches."
